                    <p>Apache airflow is an awesome tool to programmatically author, schedule and monitor Workflow. you can write any number of complex processes as a task in a workflow dag and set there dependency to achieve any complex requirement. Not only this you can also monitor and debug the task through a user-friendly web UI. The below article is not a complex workflow but a simple one in which I have demonstrated how you can create a DAG to load data from one BigQuery table to another table.</p>
